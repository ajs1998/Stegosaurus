# Stegosaurus Engine

This is a steganography engine that encodes binary data into an image file (specifically in PNG format).

## Installation

Run PremakeScript.bat and build StegosaurusApplication with Visual Studio 2019.

There are two main projects: StegosaurusEngine and StegosaurusApplication. The engine is compiled into a .lib file that you could use in your own program. The Application project is a command line tool that takes user input and uses the engine library to encode and decode information to and from images.
